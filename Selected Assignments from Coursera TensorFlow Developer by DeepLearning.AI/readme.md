1. C2W4_Assignment: __Computer Vision__ model using Conv2D and Pooling layers to enhance DNN model for classifying images of Scissor, Paper, Stone - from __Sign Language MNIST Kaggle dataset__.
2. C3W2_Assignment: __Natural Language Processing__ model using simple DNN model for classifying news articles into 5 different categories - from __BBC News Report Kaggle dataset__.  
3. C4W2_Assignment: __Time Series Prediction__ assignment focusing on transforming timeseries dataset into windowed datasets and setting up learning rate scheduler object to vary learning rate while training the model. (Still using simple DNN model)
4. C4W4_Assignment: __Time Series Prediction__ model using Conv1D and LSTM layers to enhance DNN layers for predicting daily minimum temperature in Melbourne (contains seasonality/periodicity).
